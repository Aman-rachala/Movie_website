# Hello website!

This is a basic HTML starter project displaying the latest movies and their rating.🦄

## What's in this project?

← `README.md`: That's this file, where you can tell people what your cool website does and how you built it.

← `index.html`: This is the main web page for your site. The HTML defines the structure and content of the page using _elements_. You'll see references in the HTML to the JS and CSS files.

← `style.css`: CSS files add styling rules to the content. The CSS applies styles to the elements in HTML page. The style rules also make the image move when you click it.

← `script.js`: The code in the JavaScript file runs when the page loads.
